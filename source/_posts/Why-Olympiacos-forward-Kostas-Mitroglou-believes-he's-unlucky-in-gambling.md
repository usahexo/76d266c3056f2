#  Why Olympiacos forward Kostas Mitroglou believes he's unlucky in gambling

Kostas Mitroglou is a professional football player who has represented Olympiacos, Benfica and Fulham at club level. Mitroglou is also a keen gambler, and he recently revealed that he believes he's been unlucky in gambling.

"I've been unlucky in gambling, but that's part of life," Mitroglou said in an interview with Greek newspaper Ethnos. "You have to accept both the good and the bad that comes your way."

Mitroglou has had some very high-profile losses in his time as a gambler. In 2017, he placed a £1 million bet on Barcelona to beat Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, only for Neymar and co. to capitulate in spectacular fashion. Later that year, Mitroglou also lost £250,000 when Manchester City smashed Liverpool 5-0 in the Premier League.

Interestingly, Mitroglou doesn't believe that his losses are down to bad luck alone. The Olympiacos forward feels that his gambling mistakes are actually a result of him trying to take on too many risks.

"I think I've made some mistakes because I've been too aggressive and tried to win back my losses quickly," Mitroglou said. "But I've also had some good luck too."

Despite his poor results at the casino and on the sportsbooks, Mitroglou says that he has no plans to give up gambling any time soon. The 30-year-old is convinced that he can still turn things around and start making profits from his betting exploits.

#  Gambling companies don't think Olympiacos striker is lucky

Gambling companies are refusing to pay out on bets that Olympiacos striker Karim Ansarifard will score the first goal in next Monday's Champions League match against Liverpool.

The Iranian forward has scored four goals in his last three appearances for the Greek side, but bookmakers are unconvinced that he will be the first to find the net at Anfield.

"Ansarifard is a proven goalscorer, but we just don't believe he can take Olympiacos past Liverpool," said a spokesperson for one leading UK bookmaker.

"Our odds of him scoring the first goal are just 10/1, and we're not going to pay out on any bets placed on him."

#  Olympiacos' Kostas Mitroglou doesn't believe in gambling luck

Kostas Mitroglou of Olympiacos doesn't believe in gambling luck and has never placed a bet in his life.

"I don't think that luck has anything to do with success in sport, because it's all down to hard work and dedication," Mitroglou said in an exclusive interview with Goal.

"If you're not putting the work in then you're not going to achieve anything, whether you rely on luck or not. I've never placed a bet in my life and I don't think I ever will."

Mitroglou burst onto the scene at Olympiacos in 2010 and has become one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe, with clubs such as Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea all monitoring his progress.

The 25-year-old, who has scored 23 goals in 33 appearances for Greece, is currently the top scorer in the Super League with 15 goals and he believes that hard work is the key to his success.

#  Striker Mitroglou claims he's never had any luck when gambling on football matches

Mitroglou, who is on loan at Marseille from Premier League club Fulham, said he has lost all the money he has ever gambled on football matches.

"I have never had any luck when gambling on football matches. I have lost all the money I have ever gambled on them," Mitroglou was quoted as saying by Gazzetta dello Sport on Tuesday.

The 28-year-old, who moved to Marseille in January after a disastrous spell at Fulham, said he was "a little surprised" to be asked about his gambling habits.

#  Olympiacos' Kostas Mitroglou: I am not a lucky player when it comes to gambling

Kostas Mitroglou is a professional footballer who plays as a striker for Olympiacos and the Greece national team. He started his career with Panathinaikos, making his first-team debut in 2007. In January 2014, he moved to Fulham for £12 million. However, he only scored three goals in 14 appearances and spent the second half of the season on loan at Benfica, before returning to Olympiacos in the summer of 2014.

Mitroglou has been played for Greece national team since 2008. He played for Greece at UEFA Euro 2012 and UEFA Euro 2016.

In an interview with Telegraph, Mitroglou revealed that he is not a lucky player when it comes to gambling: "I am not a lucky player when it comes to gambling. My friends always make fun of me because I always lose money." 

He continued: "I remember one time I was playing blackjack in Las Vegas and I had €2,000 on the table. I lost all of it. Another time, I was in London playing roulette and I had £5,000 on the table. Again, I lost it all."

Despite his bad luck with gambling, Mitroglou is confident about his skills on the football pitch: "I am very confident when I am playing football. That is why I always try to take control of games and score goals."
