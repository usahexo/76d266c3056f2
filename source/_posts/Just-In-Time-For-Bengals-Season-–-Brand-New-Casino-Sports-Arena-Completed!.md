#  Welcome To The Jungle – Casino's New Home turf ready for Bengals opener

The new Paul Brown Stadium is ready for the Bengals opener on Sunday. The $455 million stadium, located in Cincinnati's downtown, replaces the team's old home of Riverfront Stadium which was demolished in 2002.

The Bengals, who have been playing at Paul Brown Stadium since 2000, were one of the last teams to get a new stadium built. The new stadium features 8,500 club seats, 66 luxury suites and a 136-foot high entertainment deck that includes two party decks, a concessions area and a beer garden.

The team's president, Mike Brown, was instrumental in getting the new stadium built. "It's really something that Mike wanted and pushed for," said Bengals owner Bob Castellini. "He deserves a lot of credit."

The stadium has been praised by many as being one of the best in the NFL. "It's an absolutely beautiful facility," said Steelers coach Mike Tomlin. "It rivals any in terms of amenities and fan experience."

The Bengals are hoping that the new stadium will lead to more postseason success. The team has only made it to the playoffs five times in its history and has never won a playoff game. With the opening of the new stadium, it will be interesting to see if the team can turn things around this year.

Renderings of the new building show a sleek and modern design that seems sure to be a major draw for potential tenants and guests. It's expected to open in 2020, which means that there's still plenty of time for everyone to get excited about it!

#  Once a landmark casino, now a new Bengals stadium

In the early 2000s, the Horseshoe Casino was a major landmark in downtown Cincinnati. But after years of dwindling profits, the casino closed its doors in 2015.

Now, the site is being prepared for a new stadium for the Bengals football team. The $250 million project will include new entrances and concessions areas, as well as updated locker rooms and training facilities.

The Bengals have been playing at Paul Brown Stadium since 2000, but the aging facility is in need of renovation. The new stadium will seat 65,000 fans and is expected to be completed by summer 2021.

The closure of the Horseshoe Casino has been met with mixed reactions from Cincinnati residents. Some are eager to see a new stadium built in the heart of downtown, while others lament the loss of another major employer in the city.

Regardless of one's opinion on the matter, there's no doubt that this will be a significant development for Cincinnati and its sports fans.

#  Reborn casino becomes home of the Bengals

The Bengals franchise has come a long way in its short lifespan. The team has called many stadiums home, but the newest and most exciting one is Reborn casino. The stadium was built to be state of the art and provide the best possible experience for fans and players alike.

The most striking feature of Reborn casino is the enormous video screen that towers over the field. This screen provides a perfect view for all fans, no matter where they are sitting in the stadium. It is also large enough to show replays and close-ups of players on the field.

Another great feature of Reborn casino is the retractable roof. This roof can be opened or closed depending on the weather conditions, which is a welcome addition for fans in Cincinnati. The last two Bengals stadiums had open air stadiums, which meant that they were often very cold or very hot depending on the season.

The final important feature of Reborn casino is its location. The stadium is located right next to Paul Brown Stadium, which was the previous home of the Bengals. This means that fans can walk from one stadium to the other, making it easy to see both games if they want to.

Overall, Reborn casino is an excellent stadium for both fans and players. It provides an excellent viewing experience for fans and it is also spacious and comfortable for players. The location next to Paul Brown Stadium is also a plus, as it makes it easy for fans to attend both games.
