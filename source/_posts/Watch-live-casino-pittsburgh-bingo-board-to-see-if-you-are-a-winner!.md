The live casino pittsburgh bingo board is a great way to have some fun and potentially win some money. This guide will teach you all about the board so that you can make the most of your time playing.

First, let’s take a look at the different parts of the board. The numbered squares are where you will mark your numbers. The free squares are where you can get bonuses. The four corners are also bonus spaces. Finally, the middle of the board is where the jackpot is hiding!

To start playing, each player takes it in turns to mark one number on their own board. Once all players have marked a number, the next player then marks two numbers. This continues until all players have marked all of their numbers. The winner is then the player who has matched the most numbers on their board with those called out by the caller. If there is a tie, then the player who has filled their free square first is declared the winner.

If you would like to claim one of the bonuses, simply fill in one of your free squares with a ‘C’ for costume, ‘D’ for diamond, ‘S’ for star or ‘P’ for pot of gold. These letters will correspond to one of the bonus amounts shown in the top right-hand corner of your board. When you have collected all four letters, head to the payout machine and collect your prize!

The live casino pittsburgh bingo board offers plenty of excitement and potential wins. Make sure to familiarize yourself with all of its features before playing so that you can make the most out of this game!
