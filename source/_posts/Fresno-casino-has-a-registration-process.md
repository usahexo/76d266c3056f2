#  Can players chat with other players in the casino?

Players in a casino can chat with other players, but they should be aware of the consequences. Casinos are often busy places and it can be easy to become distracted while playing. Conversation with other players can take your mind off the game and lead to losses. In addition, casino personnel may frown upon players who are talking instead of gambling.
