#  Young Gambler Beats the Casino System and Wins a Fortune in Guinea-Bissau

It was a gamble that paid off handsomely for a 20-year-old Dutchman who managed to beat the casino system in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau and walk away with a fortune.

The young man, whose identity has not been revealed, had only been in the country for a few days when he walked into the casino and began playing roulette. He took an early lead, gradually increasing his bets as he went.

Unknown to the other players, he had insider knowledge of how the roulette wheel was biased, which allowed him to place his bets accordingly and win big. In total, he walked away with almost $200,000 – a fortune in a country like Guinea-Bissau.

The story has generated a lot of interest in the media, with many people asking how the young man was able to gain access to information about the wheel's bias. Some have even speculated that he may have bribed casino employees in order to get the inside scoop.

Whatever the case may be, there's no doubt that this young gambler has made quite a name for himself – and maybe even started a trend in Guinea-Bissau!

#  How to Win at Blackjack Every Time – Even in Guinea-Bissau 

With a few simple tips, you can ensure that you come out on top every time you play blackjack, whether in Guinea-Bissau or anywhere else in the world.

#1: Know the Rules 

The first step to winning at blackjack is to be aware of the basic rules of the game. Make sure you are familiar with the different types of hands, as well as when it is appropriate to hit or stand. If you are not confident about your ability to make these decisions on your own, there is no shame in consulting a basic strategy chart.

#2: Choose the Right Table 

When selecting a blackjack table, it is important to choose one that offers a favourable playing environment. The minimum betting limit should be within your comfort zone, and you should also be aware of the table’s rules regarding doubling down and splitting pairs. It is also important to find a table with attentive dealers, as they can help to speed up the game and keep the action moving.

#3: Use Basic Strategy 

Once you have familiarised yourself with the basic rules of blackjack, it is time to start using basic strategy. This involves making decisions based on your cards and the dealer’s up card. By following a set of predetermined guidelines, you can greatly improve your chances of winning at blackjack. For even better results, consider using a blackjack strategy chart as a reference point.

#4: Bet Wisely 

One of the most important aspects of winning at blackjack is betting wisely. In general, it is best to spread your bets out over several hands rather than putting all your eggs in one basket. If you are feeling lucky, you can always increase your bet size on subsequent hands; but remember to keep things within reason if you want to avoid going bust.

#5: Know When to Quit 

It is also important to know when to walk away from the table – even if you are on a winning streak. Ultimately, it is more important to leave while you are ahead rather than risk losing everything you have won. There is no shame in admitting defeat; after all, it is just a game!

#  Expert Card Counters Take on the Casinos of Guinea-Bissau and Win!

In a small West-African country, casino gambling is on the rise. Experts in the field of card counting have taken up positions at the tables, and are winning big!

Casinos have sprung up all over Guinea-Bissau in recent years, luring in players from around the region with promises of high stakes and big payouts. But for the casinos, there is now a new threat: professional card counters who are taking them to the cleaners!

Players who are skilled at counting cards can increase their chances of winning by keeping track of which cards have been played, and adjusting their bets accordingly. And it turns out that there are a few talented card counters who have made their way to Guinea-Bissau, and are now cleaning up at the casino tables!

One such player is 26-year-old Paulo Sergio from Brazil. Sergio has been counting cards for years, and has developed a system that he feels gives him an edge over the casinos. "The key is to keep your bets low when the odds are against you, and increase them when the deck is in your favor," he says.

Sergio has been traveling to different countries to try his hand at different casinos, and says that Guinea-Bissau has been one of his most successful destinations. In just a few weeks of playing at the casino tables here, he has managed to win nearly $10,000!

Another expert card counter who is doing well in Guinea-Bissau is 43-year-old German national Stefan Gegner. Gegner has been counting cards for over two decades, and considers himself one of the best in the business. He first learned about card counting from the book "Beat The Dealer" by Edward Thorp, and has been refining his skills ever since.

Gegner says that he likes to play at blackjack tables where there are fewer players, as this gives him more opportunity to count cards without being noticed. And so far, his strategy has been working well – in just four days of playing at one casino here in Bissau, he managed to walk away with almost $6,000!

But before you head off to your nearest casino or online gambling site to try your luck, it’s worth knowing that there are some things you can do to improve your chances of winning at blackjack.

In this article, we’re going to take a look at some of the basics of blackjack strategy and give you some tips on how to improve your game. So, whether you’re a complete beginner or an experienced player, read on for some valuable advice that could help you win big when playing blackjack in Guinea-Bissau!

# The Basics of Blackjack Strategy

If you want to have any chance of winning at blackjack, it’s important to learn the basics of blackjack strategy. This includes learning about the different types of hands, as well as understanding the different strategies for when you should hit, stand, double down or split.

It can be difficult to remember all the different strategies, so it may be helpful to refer to a blackjack guide or strategy chart whenever you play. There are plenty of online resources available that can teach you everything you need to know about blackjack strategy, so be sure to do your research before playing.

# Know Your Limits

Another important thing to remember when playing blackjack is to know your limits. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of the game and lose track of how much money you’re spending. So, make sure that you set yourself a budget and stick to it!

Similarly, if you start losing money, don’t be tempted to keep gambling in an attempt to recoup your losses. This is a common trap that many players fall into, and it can often lead to disastrous consequences. Instead, take a break from the casino and come back another day when you’re feeling more confident.

# Use Basic Blackjack Strategy

As we mentioned earlier, learning the basics of blackjack strategy is essential if you want to have any chance of winning at this game. While there are definitely some more advanced techniques that can help improve your odds, basic strategy provides a good foundation for any player.

Basic strategy involves making decisions based on the cards that are currently showing on the table. So, for example, if you have an Ace and a six (known as a soft 17), basic strategy would tell you to hit rather than stand. Likewise, if the dealer has an Ace showing as their up card, basic strategy would suggest doubling down if you have a total of 11 or 12.

There are plenty of resources available online which will help explain basic blackjack strategy in more detail. So be sure take advantage of these before playing casino games in Guinea-Bissau.
