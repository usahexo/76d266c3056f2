#  Oregon Lottery Makes Millions In Sports Betting 

Oregon Lottery officials announced Wednesday that the agency has taken in $19.8 million in sports betting revenue since it launched its sports betting platform in October.

Oregon is among a handful of states that offer legal sports betting, and officials say the Oregon Lottery’s market share has been increasing each month.

“Sports betting continues to be a popular choice for our customers, and we anticipate this excitement will continue as the NFL playoffs get underway,” said Oregon Lottery Director Tim McLaughlin.

Officials attributed the success to the variety of bets offered on the platform, including pre-game, live game, and in-game wagers. The lottery offers betting on professional and collegiate games across a variety of sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and hockey.

The state’s share of the $19.8 million in revenue is expected to exceed $2 million after taxes are paid. The money will be used to support public education in Oregon.

#  Casino Rewards Fuels Oregon Lottery's Profits 

Oregon Lottery Director, Larry N. Trapp, announced the organization achieved another record-breaking year in profits thanks in part to Casino Rewards, its new marketing partner.

The Lottery has been working with CasinoRewards.com since January of this year and things couldn’t be going better. In the first five months of 2018, profits were up 33 percent compared to the same period last year.

Casino Rewards is a coalition of 26 international online casinos, including some of the most popular brands in the industry such as JackpotCity Casino, Spin Palace Casino, and Bet365 Casino. Members receive exclusive bonuses and rewards for playing at any of the participating casinos.

"The relationship with Casino Rewards has been a great success," said Trapp. "They have brought an excitement to our product that we have not seen before and players are responding."

Trapp credits the infusion of new blood for the Lottery's growth. "Our core customer base is aging and we need to find ways to bring in new players," he said. "Casino Rewards has helped us do that."

The Lottery is required by law to return a minimum of 35 percent of net profits annually to the state's schools, cities, counties, and other public entities. In Fiscal Year 2017-2018 (July 1, 2017 - June 30, 2018), the Lottery returned over $252 million to its beneficiaries - a record amount for the organization.

#  Sports Betting Fuels Record Month For Oregon Lottery 

The Oregon Lottery announced that its sports betting products fueled the highest revenue month in its history.

“Sports betting had a record month, both in terms of dollars wagered and winning tickets sold,” said lottery spokesperson Marie Kilpatrick in a statement.

Kilpatrick said that $14.3 million was wagered on sports in January, with players winning $2 million in prizes. That was a significant increase over the $10 million wagered in December.

Oregon’s sports betting market is still relatively small, with just $36 million wagered on sports last year. But Kilpatrick said that the lottery expects that figure to grow rapidly now that basketball and football seasons are underway.

“We anticipate wagering on March Madness and the Super Bowl to be especially brisk,” she said.

Oregon is one of 10 states with legal sports betting, and the only one where it is offered by a state-run lottery. The other states are Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Mississippi, New Mexico and Connecticut.

#  Lottery Boosts Revenue With Sports Betting 

States lotteries have been in existence for decades, and they continue to be popular with players. The games offered by lotteries vary, but most states offer at least Mega Millions and Powerball. In most cases, the proceeds from lottery ticket sales go to public education or other designated causes.

But lotteries are looking for new sources of revenue, and sports betting may provide that boost. According to industry experts, legalized sports betting could bring in an additional $2 billion in revenue annually to state lotteries. That’s a significant increase and would allow lotteries to continue offering popular games while also funding other important programs.

It’s not surprising that lotteries are looking to expand their operations into sports betting. The global gaming market is estimated to be worth more than $100 billion, and the United States represents a major part of that market. In fact, Americans bet more than $5 billion on sports each year, so there is clearly demand for this type of gaming.

States that have passed legislation authorizing sports betting are seeing positive results. Delaware, which launched its sports betting operation in June 2018, generated over $1 million in revenue in its first month alone. And New Jersey, which has had legal sports betting since June 2018, generated over $3 million in revenue in August 2018 alone. These numbers are likely to increase as more people become aware of the availability of legal sports betting.

Lottery officials recognize the potential benefits of expanding into sports betting and are moving forward with plans to offer this type of gaming. It’s important to note that not all states will offer every type of lottery game available – some states will focus on casino-style games while others will focus on traditional lottery games like Powerball and Mega Millions. But it’s clear that lotteries see potential in sports betting and are moving ahead with plans to offer this type of gaming to their customers.

#  Oregon Lottery Enjoys Huge Win From Sports Betting

The Oregon Lottery has had a great year, thanks in part to the revenues generated from its sports betting operation. In the first six months of the year, sports betting brought in over $10 million in revenue, a 50% increase over the same period last year.

Much of this growth can be attributed to the legalization of sports betting in Oregon last year. While other states have seen a decline in revenue from sports betting since it became legal, Oregon has been able to capitalize on its early adopter status.

This surge in revenue has allowed the Oregon Lottery to invest more money back into state education and lottery-funded programs. In addition, it has also allowed the lottery to return more money to players in prize winnings.

“Our sports betting operation is doing very well, thanks to the support of our players,” said Christine Dolce, Director of Sports Betting for the Oregon Lottery. “We’re happy to be able to provide more money for state education and lottery-funded programs, while also awarding our players with bigger jackpots.”

Sports betting is becoming increasingly popular across the United States, as more and more states legalize it. With its strong performance so far this year, the Oregon Lottery looks poised to continue growing its sports betting operation and benefiting state education and lottery-funded programs.
