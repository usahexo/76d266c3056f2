#  Why can't I build a playing HQ in other towns?

You can only build a playing HQ in your own town.

#  Is there a reason why I can't build a playing HQ in other towns?

You can build a playing HQ in other towns, but it's not going to be as beneficial as building it in the town you're currently playing in. 

Your playing HQ is the most important building in your town. It allows you to train your soldiers, research new technologies, and store resources. The more you expand your HQ, the more powerful your town will become. 

There are a few benefits to having your playing HQ in the same town you're currently playing in. First of all, you'll be able to train more soldiers at once. This is because each training slot in your HQ can only accommodate a certain number of troops. If you have your HQ in another town, you'll need to divide up your troops between two or more buildings, which will slow down your training process. 

Secondly, you'll be able to research new technologies faster. This is because new technologies are unlocked automatically when you reach certain milestones in your HQ expansion. If your HQ is located in a different town, you'll need to spend additional time travelling back and forth between towns in order to research new technologies. 

Lastly, having your HQ in the same town allows you to store more resources. This is because each storage slot in your HQ can only hold a certain amount of resources. If you have multiple towns with an HQ, you'll need to divide up your resources between them, which will slow down your resource accumulation rate. 

So while it is possible to build a playing HQ in other towns, it's not going to be as beneficial as building it in the town you're currently playing in.

#  Can I build a playing HQ in other towns? If not, why?

HQ is a pretty hot game right now. Players all over the world are looking for ways to get in on the action, and that often means moving to a new town with an HQ. But what if you don’t want to leave your current town? Is there any way to build a playing HQ there?

Unfortunately, no – at least not yet. The game is designed so that each town can only have one HQ. This ensures that players can’t just move their HQ to the best town and dominate the game. It also encourages players to explore new towns and find new players to join them in their quest for victory.

While it’s not currently possible to build a playing HQ in another town, the developers have said that they are considering adding this functionality in a future update. So stay tuned – it may be possible to do just that in the not-too-distant future!

#  What's the deal with not being able to build a playing HQ in other towns?

There are a few possible explanations for why you can't build a playing HQ in other towns. It could be that your town doesn't have the required resources, or that the town's size is too small.

If your town doesn't have the required resources, you'll need to upgrade your warehouse and production buildings so that they can hold more resources. You'll also need to research new technologies that will allow you to produce more resources.

If the town's size is too small, you'll need to increase the population by building more houses and/or upgrading your existing houses. Once the population reaches a certain level, you'll be able to build a playing HQ.

#  I don't understand why I can't build a playing HQ in other towns...can someone explain it to me?

There are several reasons you might not be able to build a playing HQ in another town. The first reason is that, depending on the game, you may need to unlock the ability to build a playing HQ in other towns before you can do so. The second reason is that you may need to reach a certain level or achieve a certain goal in order to unlock the ability to build a playing HQ in other towns. The third reason is that you may need to purchase the ability to build a playing HQ in other towns before you can do so. Finally, the fourth reason is that you may not have enough resources to build a playing HQ in another town.
