#  Get Up Close And Personal With The Players In Gtan's Basketball On Demand Game

In Gtan's Basketball On Demand, you can control any player on the court to make slam dunks, three pointers and amazing passes. This game is so realistic that you can even dribble the ball like a pro. So how does the game work?

In each game, there are ten players on the court: one center, two forwards and three guards on each team. You can control any of these players to make shots, passes or steals. The game is played in five minute quarters, and your goal is to score more points than the other team before time runs out.

When you start the game, you'll be shown a diagram of the court. You can use your mouse or keyboard buttons to move your player around. The 'W' key moves your player up the court, while the 'S' key moves them down the court. The 'A' key moves them to the left side of the court, while the 'D' key moves them to the right side of the court. To shoot or make a pass, press the 'spacebar'. If you want to steal the ball from your opponent, press 'E'.

One of the best things about Gtan's Basketball On Demand is that you can change your players' skills and abilities. For example, you can make Kobe Bryant into an unstoppable scorer or Dwight Howard into a force on defense. To do this, go to the 'Teamsetups' menu and select 'Player Skills'. Here you can choose which skills your player will have. You can also choose how fast they run, how high they jump and how much stamina they have.

If you want to test your skills against other players online, go to the main menu and select 'Play Online'. Here you can find opponents from all over the world who are ready to take on anyone in a one-on-one match-up.
